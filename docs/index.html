            <p>
                For many years Dr. Mary Lynn Manns and Dr. Linda Rising have research the field of change initiatives
                and
                change process. The result of their researches was a kind of framework for better and less conflictual
                change process – the fearless change patterns. These patterns are a collection of possible ways to
                support
                the change process. But to be successful in a change you do not have to meet all the patterns. Instead
                of
                that you must find the mixture of the right patterns and utilize them at the right time. The book
                ‘Fearless
                Change: Patterns for introducing New Ideas’ will help to understand the patterns and to figure out which
                pattern should be used to deal with a specific complication in the change process. The approaches that
                can
                be conducted with the help of the patterns vary widely, due to the fact that every organization and
                project
                faces different complications during a change. For example, the introduction of a new E-Mail System can
                be
                very difficult in an old fashion and strict company, whereas in a start-up a change like that will be
                much
                easier to be realized. This simple example reflects the fact, that the circumstances and the environment
                of
                the change have a high influence on the change process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to this complications that can occur during a change process it would be great if every project
                leader
                of a change process would know all the patterns. But because there are over sixty patterns it is very
                hard
                to have all of them on your mind. And if you know there is a pattern for your problem but can not
                remember
                the content or the name of the pattern it is hard to figure out with pattern you must use. The only way
                to
                find the right pattern is to flick through the book until you find the pattern you are looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this purpose we have developed an app, which will be explained in the following chapters. This
                documentation mainly deals with features, architecture and development problems.

                        Android Jetpack "is a collection of Android software components to make it
                        easier for you to develop great Android apps. These components help you follow best practices,
                        free you from writing boilerplate code, and simplify complex tasks, so you can focus on the code
                        you care about." (https://developer.android.com/jetpack/) Because of this reasons, Jetpack is
                        used in the app. But not every Jetpack component is used, only the following:

                    <p>
                        <strong>Lifecycles:</strong>
                        This component manages the lifecycles of activities and fragments
                        in the app. For
                        example when navigating from the dashboard activity to the search acitivity, the
                        lifecycle-status of both activities changes. The Lifecycles-Component helps to react to this
                        changes and handle them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>LiveData:</strong>
                        LiveData is an observable to inform the activities and fragments about changes on the
                        data in the database. But it is more then a classic observable. It works together with the
                        Lifecylcles-Component and throws only, when the lifecycle is in active state. So it is not
                        necessary to manually check if data is updated every time. For example when a pattern is markes
                        as favorite in one activity, the other activity also knows this, when navigating back without a
                        manual update.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>ViewModel:</strong>
                        This component stores UI-Data and works also together with the lifecycle component.
                        It helps to hold data when the component state changes or the configuration changes. For example
                        when the user rotates the screen, the ViewModel holds the data and the developer have not to
                        fetch the data again from database. This makes development easier and faster and increases the
                        performance of the application, as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Room:</strong>
                        The data is saved in an Android-SQLite-Database. But there is an additional Layer above the
                        database that we used. That is the "Room Persistence Library" which makes it easier to work with
                        the database. More information about that library can be found

                                            The app currently consists of one activity, since the individual contents are stored in
                                            fragments. These fragments are placed on the main activity with the help of the Navigation

                                            Android Jetpack when navigating within the app.
                                            This is because some components, like the BottomBar and the ActionBar, can be placed once on the
                                            Main Activity and therefore do not have to be reloaded during navigation.

                The <strong>Patterns</strong> entity represents a Fearless Change pattern. This includes the title, the
                problem, the solution, and the summary. It also has an image name that corresponds to a drawable name in
                the source code. The ID is not stored here because it is not static. In addition, Pattern contains a
                Boolean that indicates whether this pattern was preferred.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>NodeData</strong> represents a note. It currently only consists of a text with HTML code to
                enable rich text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Todos</strong> represent a todo. It has a boolean state, which stores the state of the checkbox
                and a text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Label</strong> represent a label. It has a text and a color.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>NoteLabelJoin</strong> connects a label with a node and consists only of the NodeID and the
                LabelID.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Statistic</strong> represents an action used to implement features like the Most Clicked Card.
                It consists of an action and a timestamp. It is also assigned to a pattern.
            </p>

            <p>
                All entities are mapped as RoomEntities in KotlinCode.

                        During the implementation of the RichTextEditor for the Note feature some problems occurred.
                        This is due to the fact that Android manipulates spans in an EditText during autocompletion. In
                        the context of Android, spans are responsible for displaying text in various formats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this reason it was decided to integrate a
                        <a href="https://github.com/wasabeef/richeditor-android">richeditor-android</a>
                        from
                        <a href="https://github.com/wasabeef">Daichi Furiya</a>.
                        This library
                        saves the RichText as HTML, which solves the problem of incorrect spans.
                        Therefore it was necessary to use WebViews to display the Notes. Loading these texts is
                        unfortunately relatively slow. This problem has not been solved yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The implementation, research and prototyping of the RichTextEditors took up most of the time in
                        this project.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The used RichTextEditor offers the possibility to create TODO's which can be used
                        anywhere in the text. Unfortunately it was not considered when saving the Notes whether a TODO
                        was marked as done or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this reason, a separate implementation based on native Android checkboxes was chosen for the
                        implementation of the TODOs.
                        This way it was possible for us to save todos as a separate entity together with the state.

                        Since the cards in the preview should look the same as in the larger detail view, it was
                        necessary to scale the texts with the view.
                    </p>

                        Android offers an AutoSizeTextView, but the scaling in this view is based on the amount of text.
                        However, this leads to the fact that the texts on the different cards have different sizes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this reason we developed our own ResponsiveTextView, which scales the text based on the
                        number of characters per line <code>charactersPerRow</code>. Furthermore, this view
                        automatically calculates the MaxLines and adds three dots to the end of the text if it is too
                        long. The InstanceState ensures that the text view still has all settings even when reloaded.

                The app offers a good foundation at the current state of the art (2019) for further developments. During
                the
                presentation to stakeholders at PLoP 2019 in Ottawa, further interesting features were mentioned, which
                can be implemented in future projects. Small bugs were also uncovered, which should be fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app is in good condition for a beta release and an extended testing phase.
                It also provides a good foundation for more Pattern Apps. By making small changes, design patterns or
                others can also be displayed.
