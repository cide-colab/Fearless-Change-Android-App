        For many years Dr. Mary Lynn Manns and Dr. Linda Rising have researched
        the field of change initiatives and change process. The result of their researches was a
        kind of framework for better and less conflictual change process – the fearless change patterns.
        These patterns are a collection of possible ways to support the change process. But to be successful
        in a change you do not have to meet all the patterns. Instead of that you must find the mixture of the
        right patterns and utilize them at the right time. The book ‘Fearless Change: Patterns for introducing New Ideas’
        will help to understand the patterns and to figure out which patternData should be used to deal with a specific complication
        in the change process. The approaches that can be conducted with the help of the patterns vary widely, due to the fact that
        every organization and project faces different complications during a change. This App supports project teams in a change
        situation by providing the fearless change patterns in the form of cards. With the help of that cards it is
        possible to have a quick overview of the fearless change patterns.
